			<p>
				The city Haarlem is mostly known for its architecture. There is a beautifull old inner city, but if you look around a bit more you'll find a lot of really clean modern buildings. The trainstation of Haarlem is also very well known for its architecture, because a lot of cast iron was used in the construction.
			</p>
			
			<img id="ImgHaarlem2" src="img/GroteMarkt.png" alt="Some cafes in the 'Grote Markt'." title="Some cafes">
			
			<p>
				Shopping is also for sure something which you can do plenty in Haarlem. There are more than enough nice looking shopping districts and in the heart of Haarlem lies the "Grote Markt" which is filled with clothingshops, antique and curio shops and countless other shops. Haarlem was even elected multiple times as best shopping city of the Netherlands.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In Haarlem there is a lot of choice when it comes to food and drinks. Lunchrooms, caffeehouses, restaurants, you name it. a quick snack, extensive dinner or just a cup of coffee, it's all in Haarlem.

				Haarlem Oost
			</h3>
		</header>
		
		<article>
			<p>
				There is an area in Haarlem which is called Haarlem-Oost. This area lies east of the inner city of Haarlem. Haarlem-Oost can be divided into three smaller areas, Amsterdamse- and Slachthuiswijk, Parkwijk and the Waarder- and Veerpolder.
			</p>
			
			<img id="ImgHaarlemOost1" src="img/IKEA.png" alt="IKEA sign" title="IKEA">
			
			<p>
				The Waarder- and Veerpoler is more of a companyterrain and this is also where the IKEA is located. IKEA is a swedisch company who sells furniture. They have a really large furniture product range and there is also a restaurant included who have all sorts of swedisch dishes. These dishes are also buyable for you to take home and eat them at home in the special supermarket, which is also included with IKEA. The IKEA is also very accessible by train if you get off the train at the station called Spaarnwoude.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
				The "Beatrixplein" is located in Parkwijk, in there there are loads reastaurants and shops. Fitness center Fitfabriek is located in the middle of parkwijk. There is also a really beautifull park in Parkwijk, that's probably also why it's called "Park"wijk.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the Amsterdamse- and Slachthuiswijk is a street called the Amsterdamstraat. This street is a long shopping district full of supermarkets, clothingshops and even restaurants. If you're going shopping there anyway, why don't you also go see the iconic "Amsterdamse Poort" which is located at the end of Amsterdamstraat and lies in the Herensingel canal.
			</p>
			
			<img id="ImgHaarlemOost2" src="img/Camping.png" alt="A camping" title="A camping">
			
			<p>
				The biggest part of the Amsterdamse- and Slachthuiswijk is the Slachthuisbuurt. This neighborhood is perfect for tourism, not only because the Amsterdamstraat is located here, but also because the area itself is also filled with restaurants and shops. There is also another fitness center located here called Kennemer CrossFit, which is a bit smaller than Fitfabriek.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On the right side of Haarlem there is a big camping site. Here you can rent a place for your car(s), tent(s) and camper(s). There are also log cabins available for rent. You can also rent canoes and bikes to explore nature with. You do have to pay if you want wifi though. Luckely pets are alowed there.
			</p>

			Tip: In the park in Parkwijk lies a pancakehouse who have a famous dutch dish called: "poffertjes". These have a lot of similarities to pancakes, but are a lot smaller and a bit thicker.
